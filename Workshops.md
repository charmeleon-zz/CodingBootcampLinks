# Ideas for office hours review or workshops (or both)

## Deeper dive into `bash`
Valuable because: basic mastery is required and will help with the rest of the course
### Moving around your computer
* review commands for moving around `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`
* review path shortcuts `.`, `..`, `~`, `../..`
* review filesystem commands `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `rm -r`, `rm -rf`, `cp`, `mv`
* relative vs absolute path and how this affects commands for moving around

### Level up
* `man`
* `alias`
* `echo`
* `printenv`
* `$HOME`, `$PATH`, `$PWD`, `$OLDPWD`
* advanced `ls`: `-a`, `-A`, `-l`
* keyboard shortcuts: `C+L`, `C+U`, `C+A`, `C+E`, `C+C`
* wildcard (`*`), autocomplete (double tab)
* `less`, `more`, `cat`
* pipe (combine) multiple bash commands
* `history` then `history n` then `history | less`
* recall: `!!`
* navigate `history | less`: `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `C+F`, `C+B`, `q`, `G`, `gg`, `/word`
* basic `grep`
* `ls -l | grep`
* `history | grep`

## Everyday `git`
Valuable because: `git` is the only version control system we are using, and these commands are
enough to master the leading `git` flows
* `git init`
* `git add`
* `git commit`
* `git push`
* `git pull`
* `.git` and `.git/config`
* `git branch`
* `git checkout`
* `git merge`
* `git log`
* `git cherry-pick`
* `git revert`
* `git help <command>`

## Deeper dive into CSS Selectors
Valuable because: very common interview questions, applicable to JavaScript and CSS, will help with jQuery
* Review of HTML, Tags, Attributes, IDs and Classes
* See: https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors

## MySQL Installation
Seriously
